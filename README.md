safe_combo_generator
====================

Inspired by guidelines which came with a replacement safe combination lock, safecombogen.pl is a simple Perl script which will randomly generate three digit combination lock sequences. It will then test them against a recommended rule set for secure combinations and output the preset number of those which pass the tests.
